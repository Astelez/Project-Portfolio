This repository contains three hands‑on projects designed to showcase practical cybersecurity skills:

1. **NIDS on Raspberry Pi (Suricata)** — blue-team monitoring, custom rules, alert triage  
2. **Forensic Disk Analysis (E3 + Autopsy)** — acquisition, analysis, chain of custody, reporting  
3. **Rogue Access Point + MITM (Kali)** — attacker mindset, lab-only exploitation, and mitigations

> **Ethics & Safety**: All offensive techniques in this repo are for **lab use only** on devices you own or have explicit permission to test. Never target networks/systems without written authorization.
