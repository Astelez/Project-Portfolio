# Cybersecurity Portfolio — Internship Projects

This repository contains three hands‑on projects designed to showcase practical cybersecurity skills for internship applications:

1. **NIDS on Raspberry Pi (Suricata)** — blue-team monitoring, custom rules, alert triage  
2. **Forensic Disk Analysis (E3 + Autopsy)** — acquisition, analysis, chain of custody, reporting  
3. **Rogue Access Point + MITM (Kali)** — attacker mindset, lab-only exploitation, and mitigations

> **Ethics & Safety**: All offensive techniques in this repo are for **lab use only** on devices you own or have explicit permission to test. Never target networks/systems without written authorization.

## Repo Map
- `nids-rpi-suricata/` — Suricata setup, rules, tests, and a results report
- `forensics-e3-autopsy/` — forensic workflow, log templates, and case report
- `rogue-ap-mitm/` — rogue AP build, packet captures, parsing scripts, and defenses

## How to Use
- Start with one project at a time and commit often. 
- Keep **evidence** (screenshots, logs, PCAPs) under each project's `artifacts/` directory.
- Replace all `TODO:` blocks in READMEs and templates with your real data.

## Recruiter View
Pin this repo on GitHub. Add screenshots to each README and a short LinkedIn post for each project describing: **goal → actions → results → key takeaways**.
